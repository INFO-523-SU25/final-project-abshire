High-Level Goal
Predict key expected hitting metrics (xwOBA, xOPS, and xISO) using swing and contact profile data from MLB Statcast leaderboards.

A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
